e ::= x | \x. e_1 | (e_1 e_2) // lambda calculus


extend with numerals, booleans etc -> done 
design and implement secd machine which implements call by value semantics -> done 

need a lot of testcases
if time permits implement tuples and projections



notes:
In call by value, the actual value of the argument is evaluated and passed to the function.
The function receives a copy of the argument's value.
